          <p>Digital transformation is about evolving into a technology business in order to compete in the digital economy. Businesses can’t transform without relying on the developer to implement the transformation strategy and deliver value.</p>
           <p>Unfortunately, as developers look to adopt new approaches that let them deliver business value more quickly, they find it difficult to get started in a timely fashion. First they have to pick a software stack to use as a foundation. In the world of open source, there is an abundance of choice, however it can be hard to compare them in terms of maturity, adoption, and security practices. Another challenge often overlooked when selecting code to use, is verifying whether that code’s open source licensing terms are compatible with the developer’s own organizational guidelines. At the end of the day, it’s hard to confidently pick the right components for the stack.</p>
           <p>It can take a long time to set up development tools and configure them for the type of project at hand. A development and test environment needs to be built and needs infrastructure to run on. Hardware might need to be procured, a range of cloud hosting providers might need to be evaluated, or the organization’s IT staff might need to be engaged to obtain access to internal machines, networks, and storage.</p>

          <h2>A typical developer’s day doesn’t leave much time for change</h2>
        </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-4">

        <div class="col-sm-8">
          <p>After the startup tasks are sorted out, that doesn’t mean a developer can focus on coding. In a typical day, instead of writing code, a developer might have to help a team member get their personal development environments setup and configured to match his or her own.  There is also the the ongoing task of keeping those environments up to date, which is even more challenging with a globally distributed team.</p>
           <p>Once they can focus on writing code, the challenge of figuring out what to do next or first can be quite time consuming. Business requirements can be scattered across email or various documents in different systems. To keep track of things, the developer might set up an issue tracker that is only used by the developers and none of the business people. This adds an administrative burden of trying to keep the issue tracker up to date, especially as priorities change.</p>
           <p>Finally, there are the problems that show up in production. Production roll outs fail, or worse there are those “only in production” bugs. These reputation-damaging problems become visible to management and customers, and they are the most costly to fix. The root causes of many of these problems are subtle or not so subtle differences between the production environment and the development and test environments.</p>
           <p>Shackled with the pressures of trying to just get things done, developers can’t afford the time to move to new technologies and better development practices. Even though developers are aware of the acute need to change so they can innovate quickly, they often just fall back on the old, established ways.</p>

          <p>Clearly the status quo isn’t sustainable. Just as businesses must transform to stay competitive, the processes and tools used by development teams need to evolve to keep up with the demand for change and the changing technology landscape. Imagine a world where:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Developers can start quickly because development, test, and deployment environments are automatically created for them, and are configured identically to avoid mis-matches in production environments.
            </li>
            <li>To avoid additional learning curves and configuration, development tools are created with modern container-based applications in mind.</li>
            <li>It’s easy to bring other developers and stakeholders like business analysts and project managers on board, even if they are geographically disbursed. The entire team can collaborate and ideate to define the requirements, the business challenges driving them, and the priorities for each development cycle.
            </li>
            <li>As developers on the team write code, integration and deployments happens continuously, without complicated configuration.</li>
            <li>Developers have the tools to help them gain confidence in the open source components used as part of the stack, while reducing risk.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Finally to really start delivering value, the platform supports a holistic approach, where the analysis of one development cycle drives the ideation and planning of the next iteration, leading to a virtuous cycle.</p>
